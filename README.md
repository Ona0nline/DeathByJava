## 🧍‍♂️ Suspects and Rooms

Each suspect is implemented as a Java class. They all extend the base `Suspects` class.
Each room in and outside of the Manor is implemented as a Java class.
You can interact with them in the code by calling the `talkTo()` and the `goTo()` method. Some suspects may give direct clues, others might be misleading.
Some rooms and areas need you to interact with them within the class, others can be interacted with in the `Victim` class

### Main suspects:
- `MrsJavahart` — The grieving widow with an inheritance clause. 💍
- `BabyJavahart` — A tiny witness with a wild imagination. Or... was it? 🍓
- `TheChef` — Loves his knives, but no clear motive.
- `TheGardener` — Supposedly had the day off. Was spotted near the kitchen anyway? 🌿
- `TheNanny` — Sweet, naive, but hiding a secret affair. 💋

### Main Rooms/Areas:
- `Bedroom, Garden, Kitchen, Library` — Explore these areas.
