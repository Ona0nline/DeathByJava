## 🧍‍♂️ Suspects

Each suspect is implemented as a Java class. They all extend the base `Suspects` class.

You can interact with them in the code by calling the `talkTo()` method. Some suspects may give direct clues, others might be misleading.

### Main suspects:
- `MrsJavahart` — The grieving widow with an inheritance clause. 💍
- `BabyJavahart` — A tiny witness with a wild imagination. Or... was it? 🍓
- `TheChef` — Loves his knives, but no clear motive. Or maybe he's just hungry... 🍳
- `TheGardener` — Supposedly had the day off. Was spotted near the kitchen anyway? 🌿
- `TheNanny` — Sweet, naive, but hiding a secret affair. 💋

## 🧩 Scattered Clues (that may or may not help you...)

> The gardener only works on Tuesdays.
> Mr. Javahart died on a Thursday - Today is Friday.
> The nannys' name is "Odelia".
> The chef has terrible memory and puts sticky notes everywhere.
